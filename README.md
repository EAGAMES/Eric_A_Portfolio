# [(SQL & PowerPoint): **American Energy Market Regulators (AEMR) Outage Report**](https://onedrive.live.com/edit.aspx?resid=EEB4C04B17EC7A3D!3914&ithint=file%2cpptx&authkey=!AHf-WDwLVwrbY2k)
Gathered data regarding 18 utility company's outages across the United States from 2016 to 2017

![](Images/AEMR%20Case%20Study%20Picture.PNG)

Main Point: 
Outages are getting worse in terms of average duration of outage, capacity loss (MW), and 3 out of the 18 companies analyzed should be investigated to reverse the troubling trend

Main findings: 
From 2016 to 2017 the average Forced Outage Time had increased from 14 to 19 hours

From 2016 to 2017 Sum of MW Capacity Loss went from 70k to 82k MW

3 (AURICON, TRMOS, PUG) out of 18 companies represent a net annual increase of 486 outages

Only 4 out of 18 providers saw an increase of at least a 2000 MW Capacity Loss, the rest saw no increase or actually decreased in MW Capacity Loss

# [(Tableau): **Superstore Sales Seasonal Forecasting Analysis**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/eric.charles.alldritt/viz/Section11_6CapstonePartIII/Story1#1)
 

Created line & Bar charts to show seasonality trends in sales (such as Novemberâ€™s sales on average are 6X higher [15.5% for the total year] than February [2.6% of annual sales]

For the purpose of helping the Purchasing Team determine by region (North, South, East and West), by category (Office, Furniture, Technology) and month how much inventory to purchase for regional distribution offices

# [(Tableau): **ChemCorp Tableau Presentation**](https://public.tableau.com/views/Section11_5ChemCorpPresentation/StoryChemCorpPresentation?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

Tableau Presentation analyzing sales data for ChemCorp

Created a line charts, waterfall chart, bubble charts, pie chart and map of the United States.

Main Findings:
 50% of gross profit ($12 Million) comes from Paper & Packaging (out of 6 different industries)
 
 For Paper & Packaging, Chemicals K, H & I represent 95% of that unit's gross profit ($11.4 Million)
 
 Breaking down by customers, Paper & Packaging has 95 unique customers, the top 5 represent 55% ($6.7 million) of gross profit for Paper & Packaging
 
 ![](Images/ChemCorp%20Main%20Image.PNG)
 
Reccomendations:
Develop a department that is solely focused on catering to ChemCorp's Top 5 Clients

Figure out a 4th chemical that Paper & Packaging wants, the Business Development team can talk over with our top 5 clients and then our scientists can make the chemical

Invest in either additional factories, or new factory equipment to allow for more cost-efficent production of chemicals K, H & I

# [(Python): **Airbnb Data Exploration Project**](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Aj167BdLwLTunyCI7FVqk4mnYBrE)

Explored Airbnb project data within the New York Area

Manhattan was found to be the most profitable neighbourhood at $3376 for every Airbnb unit on average

# [(Python): **Southern Water Corp Statistics Project**](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Aj167BdLwLTunyEvBuR7qbeU-B7J?e=sIJfbs)
Data exploration of how engineering statistics impact whether a water desalination pump will fail or not

If the rolling 30-min average Standard Deviation is used, it can be determined ahead of time if a pump will fail or not

Looking closely at the chart, certain variables increase before the pump fails

# [(Python): **Southern Water Corp Multi-Regression Project**](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Aj167BdLwLTunmqm898H2mCICYl1)
Created a mutlifactor regression equation that can predict pump failure (within 10 minutes before it actually occurs) using multiple engineering variables

# [(Excel): **Southern Water Corp Inferential Statistics**](https://1drv.ms/x/s!Aj167BdLwLTunVcQhOwoYm8Rvpwp?e=0HduA9)

Created 30-minute rolling averages and rolling standard deviation averages to analyze whether a water-pump would fail

Created single-variable regression equations and a multi-regression variable equation (R=0.6 to 0.69) that predicted water pump failure

# [(Excel): **Southern Water Corp Financial Analysis**](https://1drv.ms/x/s!Aj167BdLwLTunT4VzIaeogNbVBwm?e=uQyheY)

 
Using SUMIF, compiled daily expenses into monthly expenses based on unit, revenue vs. Expense. Discovered out of the 3 desalination units (Kootha, Surjey and Jutik), Jutik produced the highest profits at $146 million vs. Surjek at $38 million and Kootha at $36 million respectively 

By profitability, Jutik had a 44.5% profit margin vs. Kootha at 25.3% and Surjek at 9.4% respectively

# [(Excel): **Southern Water Corp Economics Case Study**](https://1drv.ms/x/s!Aj167BdLwLTunUyIptlAsTT79Yi3?e=rfgY8m) 

Using SUMIFS equations, found that the more water is produced from all 3 operating units. Such as if Kootha produced 98k Mega-Litres of water, that would cost $37.17 for every Mega-Litre of water. If production doubles to 185k Mega-Litres, the cost goes down to $18.93 for every Mega-Litre or roughly half

# [(SQL/Jupyter Notebook): NYC Test Scores**](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Aj167BdLwLTun3nGN84cbFsxqLKk)

Out of 375 schools in New York City, there are 4 (1%) that have an average Math SAT score of at least 700
According to Soloman Admissions Consulting, in order to be competitive for applying to an Ivy League school a 1550+ (775 for Reading and Math) combined SAT score is needed (https://www.solomonadmissions.com/post/what-is-a-good-sat-score-for-ivy-league)

# [(SQL/Jupyter Notebook): Nike and Adidas Sales and Product Reviews**](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Aj167BdLwLTun3oD5V3PjYs50rYP)

The correlation between reviews and revenue of individual items for both Nike and Adidas products is R^2 = .65. Meaning the more reviews a product has, the more revenue it makes

The winter months (January-March) tend to have the highest number of reviews for both Nike and Adidas products. Could be due to holiday shopping, along with New Year's Resolutions

The median amount of revenue that footwear makes is $3,118 vs. apparel at $504 or footwear has a 6X higher median revenue than apparel

# [(SQL/Jupyter Notebook): Video Game Sales and Reviews**](https://1drv.ms/b/s!Aj167BdLwLTun3vU4bjTyoq7IZwq)

The late 1990's and late 2000's were the highest in terms of highest average review scores that gamers loved, along with critics loving 1990-95 (average critic score at least 9 out of 10 for all years)

The highest total number of games sold was in 2008 at 175 million
