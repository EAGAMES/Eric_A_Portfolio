1. **American Energy Market Regulators (AEMR) Outage Report** (https://onedrive.live.com/edit.aspx?resid=EEB4C04B17EC7A3D!3914&ithint=file%2cpptx&authkey=!AHf-WDwLVwrbY2k)
Using SQL, gathered data regarding 18 utility company's outages across the United States from 2016 to 2017.

Main Point: Outages are getting worse in terms of average duration of outage, capacity loss (MW), and 3 out of the 18 companies analyzed should be investigated to reverse the troubling trend.

-Main findings included: 
From 2016 to 2017 the average Forced Outage Time had increased from 14 to 19 hours.

From 2016 to 2017 Sum of MW Capacity Loss went from 70k to 82k MW.

3 (AURICON, TRMOS, PUG) out of 18 companies represent a net annual increase of 486 outages

Only 4 out of 18 providers saw an increase of at least a 2000 MW Capacity Loss, the rest saw no increase or actually decreased in MW Capacity Loss.


2. **Superstore Sales Seasonal Forecasting Analysis** (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/eric.charles.alldritt/viz/Section11_6CapstonePartIII/Story1#1)
-A Tableau Presentation, regarding an analysis of Superstore's 2015-18 sales data.

-Main findings indicate that any month's seasonal share of sales can vary from as low as 2% of sales for February or as high as 15.5% in November. Or how Q1 2016 sales was $62k to $181k in Q4 2016 to only drop $93k in Q1 2017 and then rise again.

-This helps avoid the "bullwhip effect" for retailers in the event they order too many or too little inventory.
